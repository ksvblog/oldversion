```math
$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$
```

```math
$$\ce{Hg^2+ ->[I-] HgI2 ->[I-] [Hg^{II}I4]^2-}$$
```

This shows as Mathjax \\(a \ne b\\), but this doesn't \(a \ne b\)

Likewise, this shows as Mathjax

\\[a \ne b\\]

but this doesn't:

\[a \ne b\] -->
